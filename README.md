# Professional README Generator 

## Description

For every project, a README is needed. A README describes what the project is used for, how to operate it, and how to add to it if it's open source. For this project I wanted to use the skills I learned in Node to create a commandline README generator, that takes the pain out of creating my own!

## Usage

Download the file, unpack the package.json, and run the code using node. When answering each question, it will take your answers and populate a README that you can copy and use in your projects!

## Credits

I'd like to thank my instructor [Anthony Maddatu](https://github.com/amaddatu) for just helping in general. The backend is very difficult, and it's with his guidence I'm beginning to maybe see light at the end of the tunnel.
